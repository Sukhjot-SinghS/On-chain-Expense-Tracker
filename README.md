# On-chain-Expense-Tracker
@For The Javascript Task 
-> I have shown the current connected wallet's address on the landing screen...
-> I have shown total number registered users using "people" array's length which stores info about registered people....
@For The Solidity Task
-> I have added a "edit name" button which lets you update your name being a registered user ,
   I added a function in solidity to update Person's name and then made changes accordingly in app.js..

ðŸ˜Šmmmm , i made some changes in css as well , deploying different div classes and adding gradient backgrounds 
  changing heading style and much more minor changes , 

HOPE YOU WILL LIKE IT .........
